# Simple BCI Laptop Control Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that allows the user to control certain keys on a laptop using brain signals. The primary focus is on capturing brain signals through EEG and translating them into simple keyboard actions such as 'left click', 'right click', or navigating with arrow keys.

## Objectives
- To create a non-invasive BCI system that can reliably detect specific brain signals.
- To map these signals to simple laptop control actions.
- To ensure the system is user-friendly and effective for home use.

## Hardware Requirements
- Non-invasive EEG Headset (compatible with home computers).

## Software Requirements
- Signal Processing Software (OpenViBE, BrainBay, or similar).
- Python (for machine learning and controlling laptop actions).
