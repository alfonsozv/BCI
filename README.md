# Simple BCI Laptop Control Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that allows the user to control certain keys on a laptop using brain signals. The primary focus is on capturing brain signals through EEG and translating them into simple keyboard actions such as 'left click', 'right click', or navigating with arrow keys.

## Objectives
- To create a non-invasive BCI system that can reliably detect specific brain signals.
- To map these signals to simple laptop control actions.
- To ensure the system is user-friendly and effective for home use.

## Hardware Requirements
- Non-invasive EEG Headset (compatible with home computers).

## Software Requirements
- Signal Processing Software (OpenViBE, BrainBay, or similar).
- Python (for machine learning and controlling laptop actions).

## Development Phases
1. **Scope Definition**: Determining the specific actions to be controlled and the type of brain signals to be used.
2. **Hardware Setup**: Setting up the EEG headset for data acquisition.
3. **Signal Processing**: Filtering and extracting features from the EEG data.
4. **Machine Learning**: Training a model to classify different brain states.
5. **Action Mapping**: Developing software to map brain signals to keyboard actions.
6. **Testing and Refinement**: Iteratively testing and improving the system.

## Safety and Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring user comfort and safety with non-invasive EEG.
- Addressing privacy and data security concerns.

## Community and Support
- Seeking feedback and suggestions from the BCI community.
- Sharing progress and learnings for collaborative improvement.
